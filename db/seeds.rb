# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# notif1 = Notification.new(title: ,
#     body: ,

#     )
# bobby = User.create(name: "bobby", email: "bobby@user.com", phone_number: "061", description: "Bobby loves dogs", password: "12345678")
# dog1.user = bobby
# url1 = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/356378/pexels-photo-356378.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940"
# dog1.remote_photo_url = url1
# dog1.save!
